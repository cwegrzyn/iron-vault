Advances a [[Clocks|Clock]], modifying its frontmatter, and inserts a [[Mechanics Blocks#`clock`|`clock` mechanics node]] into your active journal. Clocks which are already filled, or which are completed, cannot be advanced (and will not show up at all in the picker for the command).

Advancing a Clock to completion will not automatically be marked as closed. In keeping with the spirit of Iron Vault letting the player take care of actual mechanics instead of playing the game for them, this is left up to you to manage as you see fit.
