Makes a Move based on the Moves available in the active [[Rulesets and homebrew|Rulesets and homebrew]]. If you've activated the [[Settings#General|Use character system Setting]], rollable moves will use values from your character sheet for your Stats. Otherwise, it will prompt you for the relevant Stat value. It will also prompt you for which Stat to roll as necessary.

When the Move has been made, the command will add a [[Mechanics Blocks#`move`|`move` mechanics node]] with the Move results into your current journal.

After it's made, you can also choose to invoke the [[Burn momentum]] command.
