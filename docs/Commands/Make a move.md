Makes a Move based on the Moves available in the active [[Rulesets and Homebrew|Rulesets and Homebrew]]. If you've activated the [[Settings#General|Use character system Setting]], rollable moves will use values from your character sheet for your Stats. Otherwise, it will prompt you for the relevant Stat value. It will also prompt you for which Stat to roll as necessary.

When the Move has been made, the command will add a [[Mechanics Blocks#`move`|`move` mechanics node]] with the Move results into your current journal.

After it's made, you can also choose to invoke the [[Burn momentum]] command.

### Skipping action move rolls

For some moves, like suffer moves, making a roll is sometimes optional. In those cases, you can still
record that you made the move by selecting "Skip roll" when you are prompted for the stat. This will
record an empty move block, where you can then record your meter changes and so on.
