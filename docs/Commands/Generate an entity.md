This command is similar to [[Ask the Oracle]], except that instead of rolling a single Oracle, it pops up a window that will let you roll multiple related Oracles together to generate a new [[Entities/index|Entity]]. You can choose to roll all fields indicated as "first look" fields in the rulebook and/or you can roll individual fields. You can also choose whether to write the results into a new file representing that Entity. In any event, the rolls you choose will be logged in an [[Mechanics Blocks#oracle-group|oracle group node]] in your journal.

You can also execute this command by clicking on the button with a die icon that appears when you open a category in the [[Sidebar#Oracles Tab|Sidebar's Oracles Tab]].

Only some Entities are currently supported, with more being added over time.
