Asset Blocks allow you to embed an Asset card in read-only mode, with only default fields, into your files. They are rendered by using an `iron-vault-asset` block and, in its body, putting the name or Datasworn ID of the Asset you want to show.

#### Example

````
```iron-vault-asset
Starship
```
````

Will render this:

```iron-vault-asset
Starship
```
