Oracles blocks are rendered using `iron-vault-oracles`. The entire purpose of these blocks is to render the searchable list of oracles from the [[Sidebar]], but in a regular note.

#### Example

Using it is as simple as putting the following in a note:

````
```iron-vault-oracles
```
````

Which will render this:

```iron-vault-oracles
```
