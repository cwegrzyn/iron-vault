Iron Vault represents various game concepts as something called "Entities". This section lists all current entities, their data models, and links to how to use them throughout the plugin.

Some Entities are "Rollable Entities", that is, they can be generated using the [[Generate an entity]] command, through oracles.

The current supported entities are:

- [[Entities/Assets|Assets]]
- [[Entities/Characters|Characters]]
- [[Clocks|Clocks]]
- [[Creatures]]
- [[Delves]]
- [[Derelicts]]
- [[Factions]]
- [[Moves]]
- [[NPCs]]
- [[Oracles]]
- [[Planets]]
- [[Progress Tracks]]
- [[Sectors]]
- [[Settlements]]
- [[Truths]]
- [[Vaults]]
