There is currently no direct support in Iron Vault for Sector mapping.

That said, the community has found many  ways of representing them in Obsidian which are considered satisfactory, including

* The built-in [Obsidian Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas).
* The [Excalidraw Plugin for Obsidian](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)
* The [Leaflet Plugin for Obsidian](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-leaflet-plugin) ([guide](https://phd20.com/blog/creating-a-basic-interactive-map-in-obsidian/))

Everything you might want to do with Sectors should be achievable with these. For example, you can create [[Settlements]], then `[[link]]` or `![[inline]]` them in a Canvas card. You can also import an image to use as an icon representing your ship's location, and move that around as you fly through space!
