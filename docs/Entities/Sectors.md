There is currently no direct support in Iron Vault for Sector-related features.

That said, the community has found two main ways of representing them in Obsidian which are considered satisfactory:

1. Use the built-in [Obsidian Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas).
2. Use the [Excalidraw Plugin for Obsidian](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)

Everything you might want to do with Sectors should be achievable with these. For example, you can create [[Locations and Settlements]], then `[[link]]` or `![[inline]]` them in a Canvas card. You can also import an image to use as an icon representing your ship's location, and move that around as you fly through space!
