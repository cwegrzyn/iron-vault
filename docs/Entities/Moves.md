Moves are a game feature at the very core of Ironsworn/Starforged games, and trace their origin back to Apocalypse World/Power the Apocalypse.

As a central game concept, Iron Vault has several features for interacting with and recording moves.

#### Making Moves

You can make moves in Iron Vault various ways:

1. Use the [[Make a move]] command, which you can bind to a hotkey.
2. Find your desired Move on the [[Sidebar]]'s Moves tab and click on it to execute it.
3. Roll the Move yourself with your physical dice or preferred dice roller and record the results in a [[Mechanics Blocks#`move`|`move` mechanics block node]].

The first two will automatically create `move` mechanics nodes in your active journal note.
#### Recording Moves

You can record your moves as a regular part of the narrative in your journal in any format you want, or you can use the [[Mechanics Blocks#`move`|`move` mechanics block node]] to have the move rendered nicely, showing the results and such. [[Make a move]] will automatically generate `move` blocks for you.
