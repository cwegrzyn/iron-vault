To generate a faction, either choose "Faction" from the [[Generate an entity]] command or click the dice icon in the `Faction Oracles` oracle group in the sidebar. Both will launch the [[Generate an entity|entity generation modal]].

Besides this, there is no additional support specific to factions. You are free to organize these entities however you want, including having multiple factions in a single file (although we recommend doing 1-entity, 1-file as a general rule).
