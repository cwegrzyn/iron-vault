Iron Vault has support for Settlements by using the related Oracle Entity, which can be rolled either through the [[Sidebar]] or through the [[Generate an entity]] command. You'll be given the option to save the results into a new file, which will include a Markdown table with all the roll results. Rolling this oracle group will also record the results in your journal.

Besides this, there is no additional support specific to locations and settlements. You are free to organize these entities however you want, including having multiple settlements in a single file (although we recommend doing 1-entity, 1-file as a general rule).
