Iron Vault has support for Locations and Settlements by using various [[Oracles|Oracle Groups]], which can be rolled either through the [[Sidebar]] or through the [[Ask the Oracle]] command. For example, rolling the `Settlement Oracles` Oracle Group by pressing the dice icon in the sidebar, or invoking the [[Generate an entity]] command will pop up a window where you can do a batch roll of all oracles in that group, or only the "first look" oracles. You'll also be given the option to save the results into a new file, which will include a Markdown table with all the roll results. Rolling this oracle group will also record the results in your journal.

Besides this, there is no additional support specific to locations and settlements. You are free to organize these entities however you want, including having multiple settlements in a single file (although we recommend doing 1-entity, 1-file as a general rule).
