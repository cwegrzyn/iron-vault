Oracles are a core Ironsworn/Starforged games, and solo roleplaying games in general. They allow you to inject randomness and unpredictability into your games, as well as serve as inspiration for what to do next when you feel stuck in your story.
#### Rolling Oracles

There's three ways to roll Oracles in Iron Vault:

1. Use the [[Ask the Oracle]] command.
2. Find the Oracle on the [[Sidebar]]'s Oracles tab and either click on the Oracle itself, or click on the dice icon in order to view its roll table in a popup window. You can also use these to roll oracle groups/Entities.
3. Manually roll the oracle using whatever reference you have and your preferred dice roller, or physical dice, and record the results in your journal using [[Mechanics Blocks#`oracle`|`oracle`]] and [[Mechanics Blocks#`oracle-group`|`oracle-group`]] [[Mechanics Blocks]] nodes.

The first two options will automatically record your oracle results in your active journal note.

#### Record Oracle Results

You can record the results in your journal using [[Mechanics Blocks#`oracle`|`oracle`]] and [[Mechanics Blocks#`oracle-group`|`oracle-group`]] [[Mechanics Blocks]] nodes, which will be rendered nicely in your journal pages.

![[Mechanics Blocks#`oracle-group`#Example]]
#### Rolling Entities

You can roll an entire entity at a time using the [[Generate an entity]] command, or by going to the [[Sidebar]] and clicking the die icon on an entity-related oracle category.

Invoking the entity generator will pop up a screen where you can choose to roll individual parts of the oracle group, or, if you look on the bottom, roll all "first look" oracles to generate the initial version of an entity.

The Entity roller also gives the option of creating a new entity file with a table of the roll results in it.
#### Cursed Die

If a [[Rulesets and Homebrew|Ruleset]] with cursed oracles is present, any oracles with associated cursed oracles will automatically roll a cursed die along with their regular oracle roll.j

The oracle pop-up window will then include a section showing the cursed oracle table name, as well as the value of the cursed die. From there, you may click on the button with the die icon to roll the oracle table itself.

If you decide you want to use the cursed result, you can click on the "Select" button next to the cursed result once you've rolled it.

This will add an oracle mechanics node with a nested cursed oracle. If the cursed oracle is a replacement, the "parent"'s result will be crossed out.

#### Oracle Arrays

(Coming Soon)

Oracle Arrays are an optional tool introduced in Starforged. They allow you to associate a set of oracles with a six-sided die, called the "array die", which will help you decide which oracles to roll in specific situations.

There is currently no direct support for Oracle Arrays, but this is an upcoming feature.

#### Campaign Elements Oracles

(Coming Soon)

Campaign Elements Oracles are an optional tool introduced in Starforged. They are handcrafted tables of story ingredients specific to a campaign, which can be used to help you in open-ended situations, or when you just need a bit more inspiration.

There is currently no direct support for Campaign Elements Oracles, but this is an upcoming feature.

#### Madlib Oracles

(Coming Soon)

The last new optional Oracle kind introduced in Starforged was something it calls "madlib" oracles, where you fill in a madlibs-style sentence with Oracle results, which look like "I swear to **Action** a **Theme** of a **Descriptor** **Focus** located in **Sector Name**. I am opposed by **Character Name**, a **Character Role** who wants to **Character Goal**."

There is currently no direct support for Madlib Oracles, but this is an upcoming feature.
