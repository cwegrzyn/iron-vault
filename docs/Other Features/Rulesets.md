Rulesets define a collection of game-specific rules that fall within the scope of the Ironsworn/Starforged family of games, but with some leeway for variance. For example, Rulesets can define Assets, Moves, and Oracles, and even things like Meters and Stats. There are various ways of defining and activating Rulesets in Iron Vault.

#### Built-in Rulesets

Iron Vault is bundled with [Datasworn](https://github.com/rsek/datasworn) Rulesets for Ironsworn and Starforged.

(Coming Soon)

Support for expansions like Ironsworn: Delve and Sundered Isles is on the roadmap.

#### Homebrew

(Coming Soon)

Iron Vault will support custom homebrew Rulesets in a variety of ways. Keep your eyes peeled for more details as they come.
