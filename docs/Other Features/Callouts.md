Currently, Iron Vault supports one special callout:

### Spoiler Callout

You can insert a spoiler callout by using standard Obsidian callout syntax using the `[!spoiler]` tag for it.

Thus:

```markdown
> [!spoiler]- Spoilers below
> This is the spoiler text.
```

becomes:

> [!spoiler]- Spoilers below
> This is the spoiler text.

Note the `-` after `[!spoiler]`. This is important: it will make your spoiler blocks collapse by default.
