 braIron Vault includes various settings for tweaking the behavior of its features, to allow you to shape it into a better tool for your use case.
### General

* **Use character system**: when enabled, this will look for an active [[Characters|Character]] file when making moves and doing other game operations. If disabled, Iron Vault will still work, but will prompt you for values of, for example, your stats. This is a good setting to disable if you only wish to use a particular subset of Iron Vault features, like [[Mechanics Blocks]] or the [[Sidebar]] but don't really care to use the various [[About Commands|Commands]].

### New game object defaults

* **Default (x) folder**: Controls which folder to put various rollable [[Entities/About|Entities]] in by default. You can still pick the folder on an individual basis, or even move it, regardless of what these values are.
* **(x) template file**: If provided, the contents of these files will be added to the end of the new entity files when they're created. (Coming Soon) This will eventually be replaced with a more involved template system that will give you more control of how files are generated and formatted, and what additional frontmatter they include.

### Mechanics blocks

These options control various parts of how [[Mechanics Blocks]] are rendered.

* **Collapse move blocks**: when enabled  moves in mechanics blocks will only show the move name and result when first rendered, and you'll need to click on them in order to see move details.
* **Show mechanics toggle**: when enabled, mechanics blocks will have a small "Hide mechanics" toggle underneath them that, when clicked, will hide the mechanics block.
* **Hide mechanics completely**: If enabled, mechanics blocks will not be displayed at all. Good for when you just want to read a story. You can also toggle this setting by using the [[Toggle displaying mechanics]] command.
* **Inline tracks on clock creation**: If enabled, new tracks and clocks will be automatically inlined in the journal when created.

### Dice rolling

* **Prompt for rolls in Make a Move**: if enabled, when you [[Make a move]], the plugin will prompt you to roll your own dice and enter the values.
* **Prompt for rolls in Ask the Oracle**: if enabled, when you [[Ask the Oracle]], the plugin will prompt you to roll your own dice and enter the values.
