(Coming Soon)

There's an API currently exposed through `window.IronVaultAPI`. It provides some rudimentary access to Iron Vault's `Datatore`, its `Character Tracker`, its `Progress Index`, and a couple of other things. This API is currently not stable and not recommended for use. It may change at any time until it's stabilized.
