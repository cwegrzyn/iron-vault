The first step in any Ironsworn or Starforged campaign is to Choose Your Truths. These are facts about your world that help set the stage for the space you'll be playing in. Each [[Rulesets|Ruleset]] comes with its own set of Truths, which are themed to that game or expansion's default setting. Of course, you can always skip right by this and start writing about your world however you prefer, but using the Truths tool is very handy!

### Truth Blocks

Iron Vault directly supports tools through something called [[Truth Blocks]]. These are also the first type of block you'll be introduced to.

Iron Vault uses [[Blocks/index|Blocks]] for many things, in order to draw special tools and interactive widgets on your notes for you that will help you during play.

All Blocks are created the same way: three backticks, a block name, a new line, and three more backticks. Sometimes, there can be something between the backticks. For example, this is what a Truth Block for the Cataclysm Truth looks like:

````markdown
```iron-vault-truth
Cataclysm
```
````

When used in a note, it will render a widget that looks like this, and which you can click on to interact with:

```iron-vault-truth
Cataclysm
```

Having to write all these out can get tedious, though, so Iron Vault generally has commands or buttons that will generate them for you.

### Generating the Truths Note

In our case, what we want is the [[Generate Truths]] command. You can run it by either clicking on the [Obsidian Ribbon]() icon that looks like:  ![[ribbon-icon.png|40]], then choosing "Generate Truths" from the menu that pops up. You can also use `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on macOS) to open the Obsidian Command Palette and search for the "Generate Truths" command there.

When you call it, you'll get a menu like this:

![[generate-truths-menu.png]]

Go ahead and set the file name to "Truths" and leave Target Folder blank, then press "Create".

Iron Vault will then create a Truths file and prepopulate it with headers and [[Truth Blocks]] for all of Starforge's default Truths. It'll look something like this:

![[generated-truths-page.png]]

Now we can start picking our Truths!

### Choosing Your Truths

At this point, you can go one by one and select your Truths.

The Starforged Rulebook gives you three options for choosing each Truth:

1. [[#Just choosing a Truth|Just choosing a Truth from the list]]
2. [[#Rolling for a Truth|Rolling for a Truth using your oracle dice]]
3. [[#Customizing a Truth, or Crafting Your Own|Customizing a Truth, or crafting your own]]

Iron Vault supports all three!

Once you've taken your chosen path, you'll be able to move on to [[Create Your Character|Creating Your Character]].

##### Just choosing a Truth

Directly choosing a Truth is as simple as clicking on the `Select your truth...` dropdown in each Truth Block, and picking whichever you like best. You may need to repeat it if the Truth has sub-options.

When you're satisfied with your choice, press the save button on the bottom right to write the results to your note.

##### Rolling for a Truth

To randomize this process, you can click on the small die button next to the `Select your truth...` dropdown. This will pick a random Truth from the list of built-in ones. You may have to repeat this if the Truth has sub-options.

If you're satisfied with the results, press the save button on the bottom right to write the results to your note.

##### Customizing a Truth, or Crafting Your Own

Truth notes are regular notes! You can actually write anything you want on this note, in any structure you want. If you want to reorder the Truths, you can just cut and paste the header and the Truth Block and move it wherever you want. Likewise, if you want to add or remove Truths, you can do that, although Truth Blocks will only work for Truths in your active [[Rulesets]]. But headers still work!

If you chose to pick or roll for a Truth, as above, you can also freely edit the results at any time to add more color, to change details, or otherwise update the Truth to your preference.

Eventually, you may even want to move your Truths into different notes, and all you have to do for that is to cut and paste the parts you want.

##### Changing Your Mind

Did you press save, but you don't like the results and you want to try again? Just press the "Reset" button on the Truth Block, and it'll insert a separator before your current Truth text, and let you pick your Truth again!

##### Next Steps

Once you've taken your chosen path, you'll be able to move on to [[Create Your Character|Creating Your Character]].
