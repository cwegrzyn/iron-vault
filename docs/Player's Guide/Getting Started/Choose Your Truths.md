The first step in any Ironsworn or Starforged campaign is to Choose Your Truths. These are facts about your world that help set the stage for the space you'll be playing in. Each [[Rulesets|Ruleset]] comes with its own set of Truths, which are themed to that game or expansion's default setting. Of course, you can always skip right by this and start writing about your world however you prefer, but using the Truths tool is very handy!

### Truth Blocks

Iron Vault directly supports tools through something called [[Truth Blocks]]. These are also the first type of block you'll be introduced to.

Iron Vault uses [[Blocks/index|Blocks]] for many things, in order to draw special tools and interactive widgets on your notes for you that will help you during play.

All Blocks are created the same way: three backticks, a block name, a new line, and three more backticks. Sometimes, there can be something between the backticks. For example, this is what a Truth Block for the Cataclysm Truth looks like:

````markdown
```iron-vault-truth
Cataclysm
```
````

When used in a note, it will render a widget that looks like this, and which you can click on to interact with:

```iron-vault-truth
Cataclysm
```

Having to write all these out can get tedious, though, so Iron Vault generally has commands or buttons that will generate them for you.

### Generating the Truths Note

In our case, what we want is the [[Generate Truths]] command. You can run it by either clicking on the [Obsidian Ribbon]() icon that looks like:  ![[ribbon-icon.png|40]], then choosing "Generate Truths" from the menu that pops up. You can also use `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on macOS) to open the Obsidian Command Palette and search for the "Generate Truths" command there.

When you call it, you'll get a menu like this:

![[generate-truths-menu.png]]

Go ahead and set the file name to "Truths" and leave Target Folder blank, then press "Create".

Iron Vault will then create a Truths file and prepopulate it with headers and [[Truth Blocks]] for all of Starforge's default Truths. It'll look something like this:

![[generated-truths-page.png]]

Now we can start picking our Truths!

### Choosing Your Truths

At this point, you can go one by one and select your Truths.

The Starforged Rulebook gives you three options for choosing each Truth:

1. Just choosing a Truth from the list
2. Rolling for a Truth using your oracle dice
3. Customizing a Truth, or crafting your own

Iron Vault supports all three!

##### Just choosing a Truth

Directly choosing a Truth is as simple as clicking on the `Select your truth...` dropdown in each Truth Block, and picking whichever you like best.
