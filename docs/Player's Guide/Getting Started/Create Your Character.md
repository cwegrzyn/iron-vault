Your character! Your character is the protagonist of your story. They are the vehicle through which you write and experience the story you're telling by playing these wonderful games.

As such, the process of creating your character is very important! In this guide, we'll walk you through the whole process, following along with the Starforged Rulebook's steps!
### Generating Your Character Sheet

What's a hero without a character sheet?

Iron Vault has a concept of [[Characters|Character Entities]], and includes built-in [[Character Blocks]]. With these two building blocks, we can build a full-featured, flexible character sheet!

You can quickly generate a character sheet by running the [[Create new character]] command (either through the Ribbon button or through `Ctrl+P`/`Cmd+P`). This will prompt you for a character name, but don't worry: you can fill this in later, you might just have to rename the file if that happens.

The first thing you'll notice, of course, is a long column of words and numbers and such on the top of the page:

![[character-frontmatter.png]]

These are [Obsidian Properties](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties), otherwise referred to as the _Frontmatter_. In essence, this is where the "data" for your character is stored. The first thing you'll probably want to do is get it out of the way, though, so just **click on "Properties" to collapse it**.

Once you do that, you'll be greeted with a much nicer representation of that data, your character sheet, as rendered by [[Character Blocks]]:

This character sheet is fully-editable and interactive, so you never have to manually edit Properties yourself, even if that's what it ends up writing to each time.

### Character Creation Steps

There's eleven steps for character creation in Starforged, and we'll be going over each one!

1. Ready your assets (page 104) - don't worry, we've got this covered!
2. [[#Choose two paths]] (page 105)
3. [[#Create your backstory]] (page 106)
4. Write your background vow (page 107)
5. Board your starship (page 108)
6. Choose your final asset (page 110)
7. Set your stats (page 110)
8. Set your condition meters (page 111)
9. Envision your character (page 111)
10. Name your character (page 111)
11. Gear up (page 112)

#### Choose two paths

Assuming you haven't already been playing around with the shiny character sheet, this is your first interaction with it! Let's make it count.

The first step after sorting cards (which we don't have to do) is to pick two Path assets. We can do that one of two ways:

1. Run the [[Add asset to character]] command
2. Clock on the "Add Asset" button at the bottom of your character sheet

Whichever you choose, you'll be greeted by this popup window:

![[asset-picker-initial.png]]
You can click on each asset category here to expand it. For example, we only care about Paths right now:

![[asset-picker-expanded.png]]

Finally, you can expand again in order to see a nicely-rendered asset card for each asset, as well as a button that you can press to add it. You'll be able to edit the asset's fields _after_ you add it:

![[asset-picker-card.png]]

Go ahead and pick your two Paths. If you change your mind about a choice, simply click the "x" button on the asset card in your character sheet. If you want to reorder them, just drag and drop them by the top part.

Let's move on!
#### Create your backstory

Although you had some opportunity to do this with Truths, this is likely the first time you'll have to make a choice about where to put something and how to organize your vault. Your backstory can go anywhere you want, after all!

Some ideas:

1. Write it under a `## Backstory` section at the bottom of your character sheet.
2. Use the `Session 0` note to start fleshing out a bit of background narrative and make it more story-like.
3. Create a separate note, maybe in a separate folder like "Lore", where you can add snippets of backstory like this.

Or anything else you can think up! As long as you write it somewhere in the vault, you'll be able to keep track of it and link to it pretty freely! I recommend making sure you put a header (`##...`) of some sort at the start of your backstory, though, to make it easier to link directly to it.

Want some help? You can [[Ask the Oracle]]! You can do this two ways:

1. Run the [[Ask the Oracle]] command directly through the Command Palette/Ribbon button
2. Use the [[Sidebar#Oracle Tab|Iron Vault Sidebar Oracle Browser]]

##### Running the Command

As before, you can simply run the command, and you'll be greeted by a filterable oracle picker. Search for "Backstory Prompts" to find the table we're looking for, and select it. 


##### Using the roller

Regardless of which method you pick, you'll be greeted with this popup window:

![[backstory-prompts-popup.png]]
The roll will have been made immediately, but you can choose to reroll by clicking on the reroll icon, or select either the current roll, or the flipped (opposite) roll.

In my case, I decided to put my backstory details in my "Session 0" journal, so that's what I had open when I called this:

![[backstory-mechanics-block.png]]
What's this? Well, that's a [[Mechanics Blocks#`oracle`|Oracle Mechanics Block]]. Iron Vault includes all sorts of mechanics blocks for all sorts of situations having to do with game mechanics, and it renders them all nicely for you! If you're curious, you can go ahead and [[Mechanics Blocks|read more about them here.]]
