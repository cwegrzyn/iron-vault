As part of this guide, we'll walk you from initial setup of your campaign through to the end of a short combat scene. This Guide will use Starforged as an example, but you can use any supported [[Rulesets|Ruleset]] in Iron Vault to play!

### Launching Your Campaign

The process for launching your campaign starts on Chapter 2, page 74, of the Ironsworn: Starforged Rulebook.

As it points out very quickly: Prep is Play. Which means: Congratulations! You're already playing Starforged using Iron Vault!

To quickly address the first section on player safety: Iron Vault supports two safety mechanisms related to the safety strategies the Rulebook describes:

1. [[Make a move|Making a move]] to `Set a Flag`, and then adding appropriate [[Mechanics Blocks#`-` (dash)|comments]] to it.
2. Using [[Callouts#Spoiler Callout|a Spoiler Callout]] to hide sensitive content behind an expandable box.

### Intro to Journaling

Before we start, we have to introduce a core concept to Iron Vault: journals.

Iron Vault has a lot of features to populate and manage your story journals. Many of its commands and actions actually record their results in a journal and render them in a nice way, so you can look back and see exactly what was happening with your mechanics, or tweak things as needed.

Since we're going to start interacting with these mechanics commands now, you should take a moment to create a "Journals" folder in your vault. Inside it, create a "Session 0" note and open it. We'll use this to record all our upcoming Ask the Oracle rolls:

You can write anything you want here! Write about your thoughts so far on what you want out of your campaign, or what ideas you have for your character. Or just leave it blank for now, and we'll just use it as a scratch board for Oracle rolls.

### The Rest of the Owl

From here on, we'll walk through the four main steps in the Starforged Getting Started section:

1. [[Choose Your Truths]] (page 81)
2. [[Create Your Character]] (page 100)
3. [[Build a Starting Sector]] (page 114)
4. [[Begin Your Adventure]] (page 128)
