As part of this guide, we'll walk you from initial setup of your campaign through to the end of a short combat scene. This Guide will use Starforged as an example, but you can use any supported [[Rulesets|Ruleset]] in Iron Vault to play!

### Launching Your Campaign

The process for launching your campaign starts on Chapter 2, page 74, of the Ironsworn: Starforged Rulebook.

As it points out very quickly: Prep is Play. Which means: Congratulations! You're already playing Starforged using Iron Vault!

To quickly address the first section on player safety: Iron Vault supports two safety mechanisms related to the safety strategies the Rulebook describes:

1. [[Make a move|Making a move]] to `Set a Flag`, and then adding appropriate [[Mechanics Blocks#`-` (dash)|comments]] to it.
2. Using [[Callouts#Spoiler Callout|a Spoiler Callout]] to hide sensitive content behind an expandable box.

From here on, we'll step through the four main steps in the Starforged Getting Started section:

1. [[Choose Your Truths]] (page 81)
2. [[Create Your Character]] (page 100)
3. [[Build a Starting Sector]] (page 114)
4. [[Begin Your Adventure]] (page 128)
