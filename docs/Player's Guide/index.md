Welcome to the Iron Vault Player's Guide! While the rest of this site documents various Iron Vault features that you might want to have references to, this section is meant to guide you, step-by-step, through the _experience_ of playing a game using Iron Vault.

You can start by checking out the [[Getting Started]] guide, which will walk you through installing Obsidian and the Iron Vault plugin, then move on to starting your first campaign!
