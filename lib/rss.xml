 <br>"Blocks" are used throughout Iron Vault to provide custom rendering of various game features. Most blocks also provide interactivity, so instead of having to manually edit frontmatter data, you can do the edits through the blocks' rendered views themselves.<br>
You can use them as much or as little as you want, just like any other Iron Vault feature.<br>All blocks are used by using triple backticks (`), the name of the block, a new line, then a closing set of triple backticks.<br>Most blocks don't contain anything in order to work, but some, like <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mechanics Blocks</a>, have special contents that determine how they're rendered.<br>The following blocks are supported:<br>

#### About

Ash Barlowe is a great adventurer but also a rascal.
Copy<br><br>If you want more control over how your character sheet is rendered, you can choose to use sub-blocks instead of the big single-block character sheet. You can remove the main character sheet simply by deleting the block (the thing with the backticks).<br>The following sub-blocks are available, each corresponding to a section of the full character sheet:<br>
<br>iron-vault-character-info - name, callsign, description, XP earned, XP spent
<br>iron-vault-character-stats - your character stats (edge, heart, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-meters - your character meters (health, spirit, etc, as well as momentum)
<br>iron-vault-character-special-tracks - your special progress tracks (legacy tracks like quests, bonds, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-impacts - impacts/debilities (wounded, doomed, etc)
<br>iron-vault-character-assets - asset cards for your current character assets and their filled-out fields.
<br>You could, for example, use this to add headings before each section, or do the following to put your legacy tracks and your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ironswornrpg.com/post/learn-from-failures-in-starforged" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.ironswornrpg.com/post/learn-from-failures-in-starforged" target="_blank">Delve Failure track</a> in the same place:<br>### Special Tracks

<br><br>Many commands have some mechanical effect, but additionally "add a mechanics entry to your journal". Right now, the "current journal" is determined simply by whatever file you have open when the command was invoked.

 <br>Assets in Ironsworn/Starforged are a core mechanic for building up a character's "class" and their "inventory", of sorts. It's a fairly open-ended system that allows for interesting combinations, and it's also the core progression system of the game, where you grow your character not by upgrading their stats, but by buying new assets with XP and upgrading ones you already have.<br>Iron Vault directly supports assets in a number of ways.<br><br>Assets in most places in Iron Vault are represented as asset cards. These cards are shown in a number of places, including popup windows and your character sheet. They are only editable in the character sheet itself: otherwise, they will be shown as a read-only example.<br><br>You can add assets to your character two different ways:<br>
<br>Using the <a data-href="Add asset to character" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/add-asset-to-character.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Add asset to character</a> command.
<br>Click on the Add Asset button in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Character Blocks" data-href="Character Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/character-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Character Sheet</a>
<br>Both of these methods will add the asset directly to your character sheet. The first method will also add a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `asset`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`asset`" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`asset`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">mechanics block `asset` node</a> to your journal denoting that an asset was added.<br>Once you have an asset in your character sheet, you can remove it by clicking the "x" button on the top right of the asset.<br>You can also reorder assets by going to your character sheet's asset section and click-dragging the top section of the asset card then dropping it in the spot you want it to move to.<br>When in your character sheet, you can edit all option fields of your assets, such as a name if the asset calls for one, or picking an associated stat. You can also mark of unmark abilities by clicking on the hexagon next to them.<br><br>You can link to an asset's definition card using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Special Links > `asset `" data-href="Special Links#`asset `" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/special-links.html#`asset_`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">`asset:` links</a>. When clicked, these links will open a popup window with a read-only, default version of the asset for reference.<br><br>You can embed an asset's read-only card using <a data-href="Asset Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/asset-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Asset Blocks</a>. These blocks will not be associated with your character's assets and are only for reference of the original asset definition.]]></description><link>https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/assets.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Entities/Assets.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 00:17:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Characters]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Iron Vault supports maintaining a character sheet for your main character.

Even the graphical character sheet is optional. The file is a normal file so you can take any notes you want.

For now, Iron Vault only supports one character per vault. Future updates will add support for multi-campaign vaults, and multi-character campaigns.<br><br>The following schema describes the expected structure of character file frontmatter in order for Iron Vault to be able to treat it as a character.

 <br>Oracles are a core Ironsworn/Starforged games, and solo roleplaying games in general. They allow you to inject randomness and unpredictability into your games, as well as serve as inspiration for what to do next when you feel stuck in your story.<br><br>There's three ways to roll Oracles in Iron Vault:<br>
<br>Use the <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ask the Oracle</a> command.

You can also use these to roll oracle groups/Entities.
<br>Manually roll the oracle using whatever reference you have and your preferred dice roller, or physical dice, and record the results in your journal using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle`" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">`oracle`</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mechanics Blocks > `oracle-group`" data-href="Mechanics Blocks#`oracle-group`" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html#`oracle-group`" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">`oracle-group`</a> <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mechanics Blocks</a> nodes.

 <br>Tracks are a core feature of both Ironsworn and Starforged, as well as their expansions, and most related games. They involve filling a bar of 10 boxes, with each box taking 4 ticks to fill. On certain conditions, one or more ticks are added, and depending on the kind of track, different things can be done with that.<br>There are two main types of track in these games, and Iron Vault supports both: Progress Tracks and Special Tracks. This document only describes the former. Special Tracks are handled through the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters" data-href="Characters" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Character Sheet</a><br>Progress Tracks describe progress towards a certain goal. There are several kinds of Progress Track, such as Connections, Vows, Combat, and Scene Challenge tracks. What they have in common is that they all have something called a "rank" (ranging from "Troublesome" to "Epic"), which determines how many ticks to add on every "progress step", and they all get filled until the player does a final "Progress Move", which determines the success or failure of the event in question, and whose action value is based on the number of boxes filled.<br>There are two features supporting Progress Tracks in Iron Vault: the <a data-href="Create a progress track" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/create-a-progress-track.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Create a progress track</a> command, and <a data-href="Track Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/track-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Track Blocks</a>. You can use the command to create a new Progress Track entity file with all the necessary metadata in its frontmatter, as well as a Track Block. You can then add any more details you want to that file.<br><br>The following schema describes the expected structure of Progress Track file frontmatter in order for Iron Vault to be able to treat it as a Progress Track.

 <br>There is currently no direct support in Iron Vault for Sector-related features.<br>That said, the community has found two main ways of representing them in Obsidian which are considered satisfactory:<br>
<br>Use the built-in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://obsidian.md/canvas" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://obsidian.md/canvas" target="_blank">Obsidian Canvas</a>.

<br>Everything you might want to do with Sectors should be achievable with these.

 <br>Iron Vault includes various settings for tweaking the behavior of its features, to allow you to shape it into a better tool for your use case.<br><br>
<br>Use character system: when enabled, this will look for an active <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters" data-href="Characters" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Character</a> file when making moves and doing other game operations. If disabled, Iron Vault will still work, but will prompt you for values of, for example, your stats. This is a good setting to disable if you only wish to use a particular subset of Iron Vault features, like <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mechanics Blocks</a> or the <a data-href="Sidebar" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/sidebar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sidebar</a> but don't really care to use the various <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Commands/About" data-href="Commands/About" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/Commands/About" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Commands</a>.
<br><br>
<br>Default (x) folder: Controls which folder to put various rollable <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/About" data-href="Entities/About" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/about.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Entities</a> in by default. You can still pick the folder on an individual basis, or even move it, regardless of what these values are.
<br>(x) template file: If provided, the contents of these files will be added to the end of the new entity files when they're created. (Coming Soon) This will eventually be replaced with a more involved template system that will give you more control of how files are generated and formatted, and what additional frontmatter they include.
<br><br>These options control various parts of how <a data-href="Mechanics Blocks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/blocks/mechanics-blocks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mechanics Blocks</a> are rendered.<br>
<br>Collapse move blocks: when enabled (default), moves in mechanics blocks will only show the move name and result when first rendered, and you'll need to click on them in order to see move details.
<br>Show mechanics toggle: when enabled (default), mechanics blocks will have a small "Hide mechanics" toggle underneath them that, when clicked, will hide the mechanics block.
<br>Hide mechanics completely: If enabled, mechanics blocks will not be displayed at all. Good for when you just want to read a story. You can also toggle this setting by using the <a data-href="Toggle displaying mechanics" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/toggle-displaying-mechanics.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Toggle displaying mechanics</a> command.
<br><br>

 <br>Iron Vault includes a Sidebar that can be opened by clicking on the die icon in the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Ribbon" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Ribbon" target="_blank">Obsidian Ribbon</a>. Launching the sidebar will make it available on the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Sidebar" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Sidebar" target="_blank">right-hand Obsidian Sidebar</a>. On mobile, you can then access it simply by swiping left as-needed.<br>The Iron Vault Sidebar then has three tabs providing some handy quick-access features:<br>
<br><a data-href="#Oracles Tab" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/about:blank#Oracles_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Oracles Tab</a>

<br><a data-href="#Character Tab" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/about:blank#Character_Tab" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Character Tab</a>
<br><br>The Oracles Tab includes a list of all Oracles available in the currently-enabled Rulesets. You can filter this list by typing into its search field, which will narrow down the list to a fuzzy match based on what you're typing (meaning, you don't have to spell everything exactly right, or even write full words in the right order). When using the search field, the Oracles list will also have its groups reordered by top match.<br>In order to roll an oracle on this tab, you can expand its group if needed, then click on the oracle name, which will invoke the <a data-href="Ask the Oracle" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/ask-the-oracle.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ask the Oracle</a> command using that oracle. If you want to pick from the oracle table yourself or just see the table for reference, you can click on the button with the list icon next to the oracle name to open a popup window with the oracle table, and a button for rolling that oracle if you then want to roll it.<br>Each Oracle group in the Oracles Tab also has a button with a die icon before its list of oracles. When an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/About" data-href="Entities/About" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/about.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Entity</a> for this group is supported, this button will invoke the <a data-href="Generate an entity" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/generate-an-entity.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Generate an entity</a> command for that Entity.<br>(Coming Soon)<br>Buttons not associated with an entity will also allow you to roll the group as-is.<br>(Coming Soon)<br>This tab will eventually also allow you to manage and roll your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Oracles > Oracle Arrays" data-href="Oracles#Oracle Arrays" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/oracles.html#Oracle_Arrays" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Oracle Arrays</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Oracles > Campaign Elements Oracles" data-href="Oracles#Campaign Elements Oracles" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/oracles.html#Campaign_Elements_Oracles" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Campaign Elements Oracles</a>, and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Oracles > Madlib Oracles" data-href="Oracles#Madlib Oracles" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/oracles.html#Madlib_Oracles" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Madlib Oracles</a>.<br><br>The Moves Tab includes a list of all Moves available in the currently-enabled Rulesets. You can filter this list by typing into its search field, which will narrow down the list to a fuzzy match based on what you're typing (meaning, you don't have to spell everything exactly right, or even write full words in the right order). When using the search field, the Moves list will also have its groups reordered by top match.<br>You can click on a Move category to expand it. Once expanded, you can click on any Move in the list to invoke the <a data-href="Make a move" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/commands/make-a-move.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Make a move</a> command using that Move.<br><br>The Character Tab is simply an inlined version of your character sheet for your <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Characters" data-href="Characters" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/characters.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Active Character</a>, as if you'd used ![[My Character|iv-embed]] (which is, in fact, what the tab is doing). It's a handy, quick way to access your character sheet, which is especially helpful on mobile devices or tablets that can't have splits or resize their splits.]]></description><link>https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/sidebar.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Other Features/Sidebar.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 00:00:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Special Links]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Iron Vault overrides a number of kinds of links to change their behavior: instead of trying to open a link in your browser, they will open a pop window/modal with the entity they link to.<br>You can use special links using external link syntax ([Name of Link](id:something/goes/here)), along with the related link type identifier, and then the entity identifier.<br>Link paths (the part after the :) must have no spaces, but can be capitalized any way you want. They are case-insensitive.<br><br>id: links can be used to refer to any game entity by their unique Datasworn identifier. It will open a different popup depending on what kind of entity the identifier refers too.<br>Example: [Face Danger](id:starforged/moves/adventure/face_danger) will render as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="id:starforged/moves/adventure/face_danger" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/id:starforged/moves/adventure/face_danger" target="_blank">Face Danger</a><br><br>move: links can be used to refer to any move by either its unique Datasworn identifier, or by its full name. It will open a popup window with move details. When referencing by name, you'll need to remove any spaces.<br>Example: [Face Danger](move:FaceDanger) will render as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="move:FaceDanger" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/move:FaceDanger" target="_blank">Face Danger</a><br><br>oracle: links can be used to refer to any Oracle by either its unique Datasworn identifier, or by its full name.

 <br>This is the documentation for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/cwegrzyn/iron-vault" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/cwegrzyn/iron-vault" target="_blank">Iron Vault</a>, a plugin for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://obsidian.md" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> that turns the beloved note-taking/journaling tool into a full-fledged Virtual Tabletop (VTT) for the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ironswornrpg.com" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://ironswornrpg.com" target="_blank">Ironsworn/Starforged family of games</a>.<br>It has features ranging from a full character sheet, to commands for making moves, and even an entire featureset for rendering pretty mechanics blocks in your story journals describing the mechanics involved in your story, as they happen.<br>The plugin is designed to be used piecemeal: you can use as much or as little as you want, and our only hope is that some part of it will be useful enough to make you enjoy your experience a little more.<br>It is not a "play for me"-style VTT, in the sense that while it has a lot of conveniences for rendering and interacting with mechanics, the actual resolution and logic of game mechanics is left up to you, and whatever flexibility you want to handle the game's rules with. The game, after all, is not a single monolithic set of laws, and everyone tends to take their own liberties with the rules in the interest of enjoying the game more.<br>You can start reading about the various Iron Vault features here:<br>
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Blocks/About" data-href="Blocks/About" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/Blocks/About" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Blocks</a> - Special blocks used throughout the tool to render things nicely and give you handy interactive widgets for editing game data.
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Commands/About" data-href="Commands/About" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/Commands/About" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Commands</a> - Various Obsidian commands, all of which can be bound to hotkeys or the quick access bar, for performing all sorts of game actions, like making moves, creating progress tracks, etc.
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/About" data-href="Entities/About" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/entities/about.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Entities</a> - How Iron Vault represents all sorts of different game concepts, or some ways that you might choose to represent them yourself.
<br><a data-href="Sidebar" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/sidebar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sidebar</a> - A handy right-panel sidebar for quick access to Moves, Oracles, and your Character Sheet, all in one, easy-access place. Particularly useful on mobile.
<br><a data-href="Special Links" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/special-links.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Special Links</a> - There are oracle:, move:, asset: and id: links that, instead of trying to open a web page, will instead open a modal window with the contents of the thing you're trying to link to. For example, [My Oracle](oracle:MyOracleName) will pop up a window with the description and roll table for "My Oracle".
<br><a data-href="CSS Tweaks" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/css-tweaks.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">CSS Tweaks</a> - Styling tweaks to make some things look nicer or more customized, such as the iron-vault-embed option for inlining embeds.
<br><a data-href="Settings" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/settings.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Settings</a> - Various configurations available to tweak your Iron Vault experience.
<br><a data-href="API" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/api.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">API</a> - (Coming Soon) Are you a developer? We expose the plugin for easy access, for folks who want to do fancier things with Iron Vault features.
<br><a data-href="Rulesets" href="https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/other-features/rulesets.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rulesets</a> (Coming Soon) - BYO Rulesets! Import custom assets, oracles, or even entire rulesets/games that conform to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rsek/datasworn" target="_blank">Datasworn</a> data model.
<br><br>For now, the easiest way to install is via <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://tfthacker.com/brat-plugins" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://tfthacker.com/brat-plugins" target="_blank">BRAT</a>. <br>You should be able to add this repo to BRAT, and it will install the latest release of this plugin, as well as keep it up to date as releases are made.<br>In the near future, we will be working towards making the plugin directly accessible as a built-in Community Plugin on Obsidian's registry.]]></description><link>https://cwegrzyn.github.io/iron-vault/index.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">index.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Iron Vault Dev Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 00:23:09 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
