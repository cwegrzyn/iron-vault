Oracles:
  ✔ better formatting for complex results @done(23-10-03 16:21)
  ✔ oracle block should encode enough info that it doesn't need original tables @done(23-10-03 14:30)
  ✔ button to re-roll an oracle @done(23-10-02 16:23)
  ☐ When a roll has suggestions, make it possible to build on those suggestions (example: starforged/oracles/campaign/inciting_incident/96-100)
  ☐ Usage (Max Rolls, Allow duplicates), e.g. starforged/oracles/characters/revealed_aspect
  Make roll YAML more compact:
    ☐ Allow results to be single string or array (and then convert to array in zod)
    ☐ For template rolls, shorten the key name (and update template string)
    ☐ Shorten some of the property names?
  View:
    ✔ Some sort of mechanism for seeing different options for a roll instead of putting it directly into the document. @high @done(23-11-15 21:32)
      So like a modal that displays different variants after you select it. Or maybe suggestions?

Entity generation:
  ☐ Create a faction from a template? Maybe the ability to include oracle rolls in a template using templater? @high

Characters:
  ☐ deal with multiple characters (find all of the places where i just hardcode to taking first)
  ✔ Manage momentum @done(23-10-02 16:23)

Other:
  ☐ Investigate using https://eemeli.org/yaml/#yaml to manipulate frontmatter without rewriting
